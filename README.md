# 🚧 State of the project & Roadmap
  State :
  
  - Contracts deployed on Testnet
  - Fix bug interaction when user try to borrow on front end
  - For testing purposes, except Markets entered on Markets Tab & Dashboard of webapp, I used mock data to showcase features (Graph, Governance).
  Indeed, for security and tetsing purposes, Governance module + Graph (History) modules are deployed on testnet, i.e contracts are made.

  Roadmap for the next 2 months :
  
  - Implement DEX Aggregator for swaps efficiency
  - Implement veToken MIA for governance improvement and incentives that will help to thwart the dumping of governance tokens. The chosen vote escrowed     model showed positive outcomes on mainnet.
  - Implement Hedhing Module to keep SEB Stablecoin peg through perps or futures market driving the whole ecosystem with more volume and fees.
  - Optional but innovative and intersting for data looooovers : Implement analytics page to showcase current usage of the protocol and users' positions
